    sup, to whoever is reading this, that free moving sprite is alan(i liked that name) you might ask so?? now what?? how does that free moving sprite has feelings??
    why don't you click "1". so if you clicked one you must see some change and also if you read my code response mode becomes active.
    even though this sounds simple it makes  a  HELL lot of difference. here alan understand that's user need's quick response and move's fast. 
    so you can ask me a question where the HELL can we use this?? we can actually use this in many places like in a BROWSER depending upon the speed of typing 
    and knowing wheather it is being typed in consteant velocity or not response can change through artififcial feelings 
    just like we when we are in a hurry we expect ppl to cooperate maybe they might not but browser will. BROWSER is just an example. the same way we can check the typing speed and 
    detect the kind of answers required like if the user is talking time to type then he probably must be thinking so BROWSER will 
    give him more revelent answers like wikipedia page rather than direct fact. you can click space to bring it back to nor mal state(nun), everything will be back to normal there
    including speed. now click "2" and voila!! you see a brand new sprite, now let us consider that as user, now open your console.log and check you will find a billion values spamming it
    well they aare actually not spamming it it is the irritation of the user, now now now now now now now now WAIT what do i do witht that??
    traditionally it is up to us to start BROWSING but in the case of this browser shows up intresting stuff ASKS US this is a simple thing but makes difference
    through artififcial feeling we should be able to crack if the user is sad, happy, irritated, curious, angry or something else. this thing can be used in places where 
    TECH has to deal sensitive cases like court rooms(probably in future), hospitals and even browser. the most approchable and feasible aspect for us 
    is browser so let me take browser again as an example where based on our freaking mood it gives us off answers. in the second state alan loses his ability to 
    move freely he has to follow user path and by the way for some reason visual studio think i assigned him velocity but i never gave him anything, probably it is a glitch.
    if you click "3" you will find a sprite objext sitting there coming and going so don't press "3", and also keep your console open it has gamestate and other values open
    in it. by the way let me tell it i 4:56(i changed the timing one second before i slept off) right now and obusily i gotta a go and sleep but my initial plan was quite different 
    , it was 10 examples giving clear image of what i wan't but i gave you two examples that the ones which are very weak i could hAVE made the 3rd one but if i don't sleep chances are i can't use my laptop
    but any ways i hope these are sufficient(sereiously sufficent no they are not) enough and by the way you said "give me the code i will show ypu the way",
    technically i am giving you my half writtten program, honestly speaking these little stuff are easy to write in java script but the problem is i had to think a lot
    to come up with some decent examples but due to technicall issues i couldn't show you all and also if you read my code you are arleady irritated or impressed by the use of if conditions in it,
    but lemme gues irritated even though i am not a psychkick or astrlologer or any thing i am pretty sure you are irritaed by the if conditions.
    since BROWSER is the most feasible and practicall option we can design it for browsing and sell it to google or other company but i am sure google 
    would ask us the data of the users feelings so maybe to a company like duck duck go they will respond i am sure(i am not a psychkick or astrlologer or any thing)
    because they are still growing up and they just have 107 employees far skilled than us!! i can take users data by adding a 5o more lines of fire base data but i didn't anyway.
    so here is the half-written code presenting you show me the way and also i am up late night as i thought it was okay to pull up one all-nighter if that is making me a billionere.
    so now do what you can do AND MOST IMPORTANTLY READ THIS ALL. thanks :).
